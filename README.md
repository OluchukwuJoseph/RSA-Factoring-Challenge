# RSA Factoring Challenge

# Overview

The RSA Factoring Challenge is a Python project designed to tackle the mathematical problem of factoring large semiprime numbers. The challenge is a crucial aspect of the RSA encryption algorithm, where the security relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RSA-Factoring-Challenge.git
```

### Change Directory
```bash
cd RSA-Factoring-Challenge
```
## Usage

1. Run the script using the following command:
```bash
python333 factors.py <file_path>
```
Replace <file_path> with the path to a file containing the numbers you want to factor.
